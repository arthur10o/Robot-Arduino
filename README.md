# Arduino Robot

This project implements an intelligent robot capable of navigating autonomously or being manually controlled. It uses sensors to detect obstacles and motors to move in different directions.

## 🚀 Features
- 

## 🧰 Equipment Required
- Arduino Uno R3
- V5 Expansion Board
- L298N Motor Driver Board
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor (SG90)
- 4x DC Motors
- 4x Tires
- Jumper wires and power supply

## 🔌 Wiring Diagram
See the [`docs/`](docs/) folder for the full wiring diagram.

## 🛠️ Installation and Configuration
1. Open the `program.ino` file using the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the required libraries via the Library Manager *(adjust depending on actual code)*:
   - - `Servo` (built-in)
   - `IRremote` (for IR remote control)
3. Wire all components according to the wiring diagram.
4. In the Arduino IDE:
   - Select the correct board (Arduino Uno).
   - Select the appropriate port.
5. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
